This edition will be written in english, and is aimed at the international community, which upon learning of\nthe launch of the portuguese version of the magazine, requested an\ninternational version.\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p>Not so long ago, we did not have access to text,\naudio or video content as easy as we do today. Without the\ninternet, few had frequent access to quality information about their\nareas of interest. Magazines came to fill that void, bringing to the\ncrowd relevant knowledge in an affordable format.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the video game scene, print magazines were the\nmain sources of relevant information for decades. And in plain 21th\ncentury they are still alive. Even with the non-stop growing digital\nworld, print magazines are still a specialized and qualified media,\nthat keeps on spreading and preserving knowledge, in a format that is\npleasant for reading and collecting.\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Shmup Mania Magazine</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe main purpouse of the publication is to\nmaintain the legacy of the print magazines that inspired and taught\nus so much, specially during the 80s and 90s, and that undeniably\ncontributed to the development of the video game industry.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShmup Mania aims to revisit the classics that keep\ninspiring developers and players, and still motivate championships\nand analysis. It will also focus on the newest releases that renew\nthe genre, bringing new perspectives of game play, visuals, sound and\nnarrative, that catch the attention of veteran players, and also of\nnewcomers eager to explore the fascinating world of the shmups.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Why the focus on shmups?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShmups are our passion, and currently there are no periodical\npublications, in print or digital format, that addresses with depth,\namplitude and impartiality the most prolific genre of video games. We\nwill bridge that gap with a creative and colaborative magazine, that\nwill help to keep shoot \u2018em ups alive and evolving.\n\t<br><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>What will be on the magazine?</strong><br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Reviews of the latest releases for the current and classic platforms.</li>\n\t<li>News and rumors about releases on digital and physical media.</li>\n\t<li>Analysis of must  have collector\u2019s editions with exclusive photos.</li>\n\t<li>Historical facts and curiosities about the evolution of the genre.</li>\n\t<li>Interviews with shmups' fans bringing the community to the spotlight.</li>\n\t<li>Comparison of the several ports of a title.</li>\n\t<li>Interviews with developers.</li>\n\t<li>Analysis of new and classic soundtracks with details about their release on physical media.</li>\n\t<li>Figures, toys, accesories and collectibles inspired by shmups.</li>\n\t<li>The notable shmups for portable platforms.</li>\n\t<li>Shmups\u2019 Leader Boards.</li>\n\t<li>The most famous and curious shmups\u2019 arcade cabins.</li>\n\t<li>The story of noteworthy producers.</li>\n\t<li>Shmups\u2019 archeological findings.</li>\n\t<li>And much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>The premiere international edition will be basically the premiere portuguese edition translated to english.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Our main goal is to evaluate the interest of the international community in the project.
