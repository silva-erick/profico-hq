You have no ideia of how much it means to me. Since my childhood I was surrounded by comics (hero comics) and my early days I was already doing graphic narratives in my way. Making a grid on paper and telling stories about men climbing mountains and fiunding dinossaurs. I was GREAT! And also a no way back turn! Knights of The Zodiac came to Brazil and it changed everything to me. And arround the age of 11, I already had produced about 20 comics (shonen mang\u00e1 inspired). It was the first artist feel I had on my life. Despite the constant feeling that I should go towards a career that would involve art (cinema, music, games were also considered) I had an unrelated academic background (IT) and the arts were walking in my shadow for a long time. When the opportunity arose to do a comic commemorating the 40th anniversary of Dark Side of The Moon, by Pink Floyd (yes, 10 years ago) and that rekindled the feeling of being an artist that I had in childhood. And I got involved in several endeavors in an attempt to make that a reality. Unfortunately, she had to be sidelined again, but the conviction that something was wrong was now really strong. Opportunity knocked on the door again, but this time maybe I have the maturity I needed to make this project work. And your help will be fundamental to me! We can talk more about this later! I have some much things in mind that your support will help me to bring them to the real world, that I can only be greatfull. Thanks again and see you later! Hope you enjoy!
