Making a grid on paper and telling stories about men climbing mountains and fiunding dinossaurs. I was GREAT! And also a no way back turn!\nKnights of The Zodiac came to Brazil and it changed everything to me. And arround the age of 11, I already had produced about 20 comics (shonen mang\u00e1 inspired). It was the first artist feel I had on my life.\nDespite the constant feeling that I should go towards a career that would involve art (cinema, music, games were also considered) I had an unrelated academic background (IT) and the arts were walking in my shadow for a long time.\nWhen the opportunity arose to do a comic commemorating the 40th anniversary of Dark Side of The Moon, by Pink Floyd (yes, 10 years ago) and that rekindled the feeling of being an artist that I had in childhood. And I got involved in several endeavors in an attempt to make that a reality. Unfortunately, she had to be sidelined again, but the conviction that something was wrong was now really strong.\nOpportunity knocked on the door again, but this time maybe I have the maturity I needed to make this project work.\nAnd your help will be fundamental to me!\nWe can talk more about this later!\nI have some much things in mind that your support will help me to bring them to the real world, that I can only be greatfull.\nThanks again and see you later!\nHope you enjoy!\nBest regards,\nDiogo Muniz", "categoria_multirrotulo_lda": {"0": 0.0, "1": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "3": 0.0, "4": 0.0, "5": 0.2, "6": 0.0, "7": 0.0, "8": 0.0, "9": 0.0, "10": 0.0, "11": 0.0, "12": 0.0, "13": 0.0, "14": 0.0, "15": 0.0, "16": 0.0, "17": 0.0, "18": 0.0, "19": 0.0, "20": 0.0, "21": 0.0, "22": 0.0, "23": 0.0, "24": 0.4, "25": 0.0, "26": 0.0, "27": 0.0, "28": 0.0, "29": 0.0, "30": 0.0, "31": 0.0, "32": 0.0, "33": 0.0, "34": 0.0, "35": 0.0, "36": 0.0, "37": 0.0, "38": 0.2, "39": 0.6, "40": 0.0, "41": 0.2, "42": 0.0, "43": 0.0, "44": 1.0, "45": 0.0, "46": 0.2, "47": 0.0, "48": 0.0, "49": 0.2}, "categoria_entidades": ["hi", "thank you very", "so special support for my", "you have no ideia of how much it means to me", "since my childhood i was surrounded by comics", "hero comics", "and my early", "i was already doing graphic narratives", "my way", "making a grid", "paper and telling stories about men climbing mountains and fiunding dinossaurs", "i was great", "and", "way", "knights of the zodiac came to brazil and it changed everything to", "and arround the", "of 11", "i already had produced about 20 comics", "shonen mang\u00e1", "it was the first artist feel i had on my life", "despite the", "feeling that i should go towards", "career that would", "art", "cinema", "music", "games were also considered", "i had an unrelated academic background", "it", "and the arts were walking in my shadow", "long time", "when the opportunity arose to", "comic commemorating the 40th anniversary of dark side of the moon", "by pink floyd", "yes", "10 years ago", "and that rekindled the feeling of being an artist that i had in", "and i got", "in several endeavors in an attempt to make that a reality", "unfortunately", "had to be", "again", "but the conviction that something was wrong was now really strong", "opportunity knocked on the door again", "but this time maybe i have the maturity i needed to make this project", "and your help will be fundamental to", "we can talk", "about this later", "i have some much things in mind that your support will help", "to bring them to the real world", "that i can only be greatfull", "thanks again and see you later", "hope you enjoy", "best", "diogo muniz"]}
